    "# Homework 1: Information Retrieval\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of three!\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deviation from the aforementioned  instructions will lead to reduced grade\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifications\n",
    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the first time we provide this homework please notify us if there is a bug/something is unclear, typo's exc..\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use Python 3.7 for programming.\n",
    "6. Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have fun !"

    "Optimizing the code: We can optimize the code by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. For example, we can use a hash table or a Trie data structure to store the inverted index instead of a dictionary. We can also use a sparse matrix representation for the term-document matrix to save memory and speed up computation. Finally, we can optimize the stemmer and tokenizer to make them faster and more efficient.\n",

      "[INTRO]. My mama took me to Sam Goody's. I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD. I took that shit home. That shit was wack like a muthafucka. Don't fuck with Game. I like 50 Cent. He reminds me Spongebob. And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues. And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer. They're my friends. Psyche. I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem. Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD. Took that shit home, put it in my boom box. Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit. Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88. I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man. So this Black Wallstreet for life now. GGG-UNOT!. [GAME]. 300 Bars and Runnin. Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes. Walk with me. Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster. Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them *****z they toy soldiers. Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober. Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover. Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer. Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed. Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat. That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back. Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground. I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown. Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square. Watch everybody sleep through it. We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em. What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it. They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly. What you thought? Them was the only *****z that rapped in Philly?. See them *****z with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly. Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly. ??? said Curtis Jack in Philly. Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly. I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops. So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock. And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops. Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot. What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot. Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac. I put purple on the block. So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot. Ask 50, it get lonely on top. You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got. When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop. You sell records but a GGG-u not!. Acting big on the radio, to me you not. You can ask Mr. CCC who hot. Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop. Run up on that new 300 C you got. Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop. And I hope you black out before you see the cops. I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block. So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop. I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop. I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped. Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot. I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped. I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back. Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap. It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap. Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track. Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat. Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back. Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back. I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped. Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap. It's about when the ??? clap, is rufus back. I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?. Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe. We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go. Drop them off, then the sound like Esko. I'm a say ??? if me and Dre talk. All Nas said back was he had a ???. Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see. *****z running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me. But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping. And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured. Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine. I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine. Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines. How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes. I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog. I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls. 1-800-split a faggot ***** wig. He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge. Now your career is over, career is over. We in QB, banging CNN in the rover. T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE. You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring. Take that shit off ???, go back to PC. And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3. I'm airing their ass out on DVD. You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me. I'm a G-Unit toy soldier. On Sesame street doing voice overs. Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines. Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes. We was in the studio, when I first got signed. He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines. That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes. All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time. Got mad cuz I ain't wanna make your beef mine. You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?. He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact. Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that. Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap. Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that. I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats. I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. I said. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it. Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving. Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it. Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music. Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer. Both ??? in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin. And I beef with any *****, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'. You can put it on skee if you want it. I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue. And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe. I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid. We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs. Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did. Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his. Cuz Bloods gonna get ya. Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain. That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots. Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops. Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre. This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say. Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes. So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face. Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes. Cuz when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake. For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes. Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake. If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake. Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay. Not the instant replay. I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like. Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit. *****z only for your shit just a lil bit. On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit. Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit. My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick. Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep. Tell Ecko to make him a suit. Tell Reebock to make him some boots. Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head. He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman. Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man. So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings. Take my advice, never wear air max for the ???. Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king. Cuz if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting. And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer. They will stab you then ??? then fuck you on Rikers. And Life Goes On. Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs. He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf. So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself. ***** stop acting tough before I stand over you. Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre. Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one. Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger. Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up. Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum. Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up. Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what. Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up. The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em. In and out of lanes like a New York cab. I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab. Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?. Got his crew starving cuz he aint the whole cake, *****. He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga. If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?. We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot. I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not. You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta. You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta. Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot. Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop. C'mon man, what happened to the thug?. Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging. ***** got mad when The Game start buzzing. So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs. Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go. ***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O. Cuz I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you. I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes. Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group. Just wanna sit here and wait. To be gone, so I can head back to the block. Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted. Pull the brim low, if they don't get it. Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it. Four times platinum, I done been there and did it. Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it. They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away. So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day. *****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play. And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake. So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away. Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay. Let me out so I can drive down criminal way. Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay. The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay. Cuz I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page. Similar to them shells going into my gauge. I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades. And Just Blaze, cuz the boy got game. Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain. Now back to reality, my gun and my vest. And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West. Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob. Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em. And the flow is hot like that wit Satan. And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons. The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em. So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em. Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars. When Game in the house, they call ???. Cuz they heard about what went on in D.C.. Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50. Now tell me do he got a conscience?. I think not, cuz if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense. Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference. I'd rather be pushing rock, like ???. 50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding. We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson. Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson. Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict. What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming. Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common. Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen. The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit. And I still shine like diamonds. They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman. It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition. I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. I'm in the hood politican, Impala ???. And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim. Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison. Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing. Then re-up like kid before the d-cup. Continuously getting money with my feet up. Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force. I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source. Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me. But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back. While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks. When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats. We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?. Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?. On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP. They won't know which hole to patch up, when the ??? clap. I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback. It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash *****?. Say my name now that's your fucking ass *****. Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass *****. Now I gotta lay you down like the last *****. Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47. This ***** playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven. Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo. Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O. And you don't want that David cuz you love your life. Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes. Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta. All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?. When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row. Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO. 50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow. Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo. You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow. And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago. I call my ***** Jojo to get it back. He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks. Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit. Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit. Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find. I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine. Take one shot of Brandy and pop. Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop. Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops. And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot. Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed. Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock. Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot. Hurricanes in store November, ***** fuck Reebocks. I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top. The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots. 280 in, ain't no getting me back. I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap. Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek. Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?. Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?. In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace. You don't want war *****, you want peace. So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?). Let 'em rest in peace. From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable. Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan. And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em. If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon. A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking. So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in. Got the weight of the world on my shoulder. Not a ***** nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over. This is crack music, go get the baking soda. 300 Bars and Runnin, ***** the wait is over. I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone. *Enviado por \"Sekef\" \n",

It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap. Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track. Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat. Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back. Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back. I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped. Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap. It's about when the ??? clap, is rufus back. I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?. Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe. We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go. Drop them off, then the sound like Esko. I'm a say ??? if me and Dre talk. All Nas said back was he had a ???. Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see. *****z running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me. But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping. And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured. Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine. I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine. Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines. How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes. I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog. I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls. 1-800-split a faggot ***** wig. He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge. Now your career is over, career is over. We in QB, banging CNN in the rover. T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE. You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring. Take that shit off ???, go back to PC. And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3. I'm airing their ass out on DVD. You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me. I'm a G-Unit toy soldier. On Sesame street doing voice overs. Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines. Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes. We was in the studio, when I first got signed. He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines. That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes. All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time. Got mad cuz I ain't wanna make your beef mine. You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?. He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact. Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that. Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap. Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that. I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats. I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. I said. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it. Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving. Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it. Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music. Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer. Both ??? in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin. And I beef with any *****, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'. You can put it on skee if you want it. I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue. And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe. I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid. We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs. Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did. Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his. Cuz Bloods gonna get ya. Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain. That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots. Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops. Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre. This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say. Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes. So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face. Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes. Cuz when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake. For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes. Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake. If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake. Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay. Not the instant replay. I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like. Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit. *****z only for your shit just a lil bit. On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit. Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit. My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick. Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep. Tell Ecko to make him a suit. Tell Reebock to make him some boots. Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head. He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman. Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man. So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings. Take my advice, never wear air max for the ???. Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king. Cuz if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting. And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer. They will stab you then ??? then fuck you on Rikers. And Life Goes On. Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs. He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf. So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself. ***** stop acting tough before I stand over you. Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre. Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one. Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger. Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up. Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum. Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up. Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what. Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up. The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em. In and out of lanes like a New York cab. I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab. Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?. Got his crew starving cuz he aint the whole cake, *****. He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga. If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?. We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot. I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not. You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta. You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta. Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot. Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop. C'mon man, what happened to the thug?. Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging. ***** got mad when The Game start buzzing. So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs. Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go. ***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O. Cuz I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you. I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes. Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group. Just wanna sit here and wait. To be gone, so I can head back to the block. Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted. Pull the brim low, if they don't get it. Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it. Four times platinum, I done been there and did it. Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it. They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away. So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day. *****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play. And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake. So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away. Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay. Let me out so I can drive down criminal way. Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay. The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay. Cuz I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page. Similar to them shells going into my gauge. I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades. And Just Blaze, cuz the boy got game. Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain. Now back to reality, my gun and my vest. And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West. Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob. Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em. And the flow is hot like that wit Satan. And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons. The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em. So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em. Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars. When Game in the house, they call ???. Cuz they heard about what went on in D.C.. Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50. Now tell me do he got a conscience?. I think not, cuz if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense. Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference. I'd rather be pushing rock, like ???. 50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding. We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson. Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson. Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict. What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming. Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common. Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen. The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit. And I still shine like diamonds. They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman. It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition. I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. I'm in the hood politican, Impala ???. And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim. Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison. Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing. Then re-up like kid before the d-cup. Continuously getting money with my feet up. Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force. I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source. Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me. But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back. While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks. When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats. We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?. Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?. On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP. They won't know which hole to patch up, when the ??? clap. I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback. It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash *****?. Say my name now that's your fucking ass *****. Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass *****. Now I gotta lay you down like the last *****. Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47. This ***** playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven. Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo. Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O. And you don't want that David cuz you love your life. Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes. Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta. All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?. When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row. Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO. 50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow. Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo. You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow. And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago. I call my ***** Jojo to get it back. He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks. Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit. Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit. Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find. I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine. Take one shot of Brandy and pop. Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop. Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops. And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot. Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed. Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock. Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot. Hurricanes in store November, ***** fuck Reebocks. I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top. The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots. 280 in, ain't no getting me back. I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap. Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek. Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?. Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?. In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace. You don't want war *****, you want peace. So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?). Let 'em rest in peace. From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable. Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan. And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em. If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon. A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking. So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in. Got the weight of the world on my shoulder. Not a ***** nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over. This is crack music, go get the baking soda. 300 Bars and Runnin, ***** the wait is over. I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone. *Enviado por \"Sekef\" \n",

      "[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]. [laughing]. Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker. Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room. 'Cause they don't fucking... (I'd like to propose a toast). (I said toast motherfucker). [Chorus: Kanye]. And I am. And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them. Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky. This is the last call for alcohol, for the... So get your ass up off the wall. [Verse 1]. The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac. The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc. I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame. And come back next year with the whole fucking game. Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top. They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop. Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself. Rocafella's only niggaz that help. My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair. Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here. They say he bourgie, he big-headed. Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is. Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds. I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas. It's funny how wasn't nobody interested. 'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir. Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir. Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest. But all they got left is this guy called West. Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. \"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz\". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin?\". I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\". [No ID:] \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like \"oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"oh. you a real soulful dude\" [Jay-Z: \"you a real soulful dude\"]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] \"check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\". \"tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, \"what you think of it?\". [Jay-Z:] \"so what you thinkin?\". And I was like, \"man that shit tite,\". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] \"Come on, let's just go\". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] \"Kanye, baby, we're here\",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. \"yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like \"yo what's up I'm Kanye.\". [Dame:] \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\". \"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics\". [Dame:] \"Jay got classics, G.\". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I. spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said \"man that was tite.\". [Jay-Z:] \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] \"Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. \"Y'all niggaz is stupid\". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\". Dame was like, \"yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\". [Dame:] \"you gotta make sure it's not wack.\". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. \"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like \"oh shit\". [Dame:] \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\". \"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\". [Dame:] \"it's actually kinda hot.\". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like \"yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\". [Dame:] \"you don't wanna catch a brick\". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer. rapper\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\". [Mel:] \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?\" \n",

Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. \"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz\". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin?\". I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\". [No ID:] \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like \"oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"oh. you a real soulful dude\" [Jay-Z: \"you a real soulful dude\"]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] \"check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\". \"tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, \"what you think of it?\". [Jay-Z:] \"so what you thinkin?\". And I was like, \"man that shit tite,\". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] \"Come on, let's just go\". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] \"Kanye, baby, we're here\",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. \"yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like \"yo what's up I'm Kanye.\". [Dame:] \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\". \"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics\". [Dame:] \"Jay got classics, G.\". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I. spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said \"man that was tite.\". [Jay-Z:] \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] \"Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. \"Y'all niggaz is stupid\". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\". Dame was like, \"yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\". [Dame:] \"you gotta make sure it's not wack.\". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. \"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like \"oh shit\". [Dame:] \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\". \"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\". [Dame:] \"it's actually kinda hot.\". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like \"yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\". [Dame:] \"you don't wanna catch a brick\". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer. rapper\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\". [Mel:] \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?\" \n",
